					<p class="lead text-secondary">Welcome to my personal website! My name is Andry, and I am currently a university student pursuing a major in coding. Technology has always been a passion of mine, and I have been fascinated by the power of programming to create innovative solutions to everyday problems. I have a strong desire to learn as much as possible in this field and use my knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="lead text-secondary">When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, I enjoy playing the guitar. It's been a hobby of mine for several years, and I find it to be a relaxing and fulfilling way to unwind after a long day of classes and programming. I believe that pursuing hobbies outside of academics and work is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and I am grateful for the opportunity to explore my creative side through music.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="lead text-secondary"> On this website, you'll find more information about me, my coding projects, and my musical endeavors. I hope that through this platform, I can connect with others who share my interests and inspire others to pursue their passions. Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi!&nbsp;</p>
